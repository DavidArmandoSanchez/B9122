Note: The code in this repository contains the main results of an excersice for the econometrics class.

This data consist of observations on 247 households making choices on heating systems.

The first five variables are fixed installation costs, the second five are variables costs, followed by household income and the choice.

The code provides the means and standard deviations (over the 247 individuals) according to a framework of discrete choice model, where the utility of each agent depends on the selection of fix and variable costs.
